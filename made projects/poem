<pre style="color: #fff;">
    I wrote a poem about you
    One you'll probably never read.
    If you ask me, I'll pretend it's not true,
    And laugh it off instead.
    But pretending is no use,
    When, for most of my poems,
    You were the muse.
    
    With every verse parsed,
    Read between the lines,
    Secret whispers danced,
    Wanting to be heard in hindsight.
    Was I in a trance
    When, in the dead of the night,
    I wrote love songs?
    
    Odes were sung to the moon,
    Praising your imperfections.
    My letters felt marooned,
    Trapped in fear's possession.
    Yet again, I wrote a poem about you,
    Hoping somehow you'll know
    How much I love you.

<div class="container" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#what">What can I do?</div>
<div id="what" class="collapse pcontent">
<pre>
    What can I do when
    My poor heart has a mind of its own?
    I see you in every poem I write,
    I tell the moon how I wish you were mine.
    How I wish I was the reason you smiled,
    and how that smile is one-of-a-kind.
    But what can I do?
    My poor heart has a mind of its own.
    They say you're not the one for me
    But this poor heart says "fuck what they say"
    
    What can I do when
    My poor heart has a mind of its own?
    Every second we spend together
    Is so close to shattering my soul
    Knowing this time will come to an end
    Knowing I'm not the one you'll hold
    But what can I do?
    My poor heart has a mind of its own.
    Because I loved like your name was written on my bones,
    My heart simply refused to turn to stone.
    
    What can I do when 
    My poor heart has a mind of its own?
    They all saw how stupidly I was in love
    While I watched you fall harder for somebody else
    How in every crowd my eyes searched for you,
    Only to find you by her side
    But what can I do?
    My poor heart has a mind of its own.
    It never listens to what I say
    And pushes everybody else away
    
    What can I do when
    My poor heart has a mind of its own?
    They said my love was pure 
    And "thou wert my joy in every spot,
    My theme in every song"
    Hit a little too close to home
    But what can I do?
    My poor heart has a mind of its own
    It felt like you were tattooed on my soul
    Like you were my only home
    
    What can I do when
    My poor heart has a mind of its own?
    You know how it is
    We fall once - only once in love
    And all the other times
    We look for pieces of that love in everybody else
    But what can I do?
    My poor heart has a mind of its own
    None of those pieces fit my heart's puzzle
    As perfectly as you do

    When my feet start dancing around to the cicadas' sound,
    The sun, with his brightest smile, bequeaths to the ground,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    Impervious to summer heat,
    But with the thoughts of someone, I'm beat,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    
    When I stare at the twinkling stars above,
    The constellations dimmer than the eyes of a beloved,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    The berceuse of April night's breeze plucking the moonbeams,
    Weaving every whisper into my dreams,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    
    As the sound of someone's laughter in my ears rings,
    Like symphonies no koel can sing,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    When the scent of sandalwood fills the air,
    And my eyes soften into a longing stare,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    
    As the air shifts into a crispy scene,
    And the smile on my face still beams,
    That's when I know I'm in love.
    When the skies turn amber,
    Curving your lips into a smile so glamour,
    That's when we know we're in love.

<div id="elegy" class="collapse pcontent">
<pre>
    If all my stories were turned into poems,
    wouldn't every single one be an elegy?
    Mourning the stars that turned to dust,
    their heartbeat now hushed.
    Where did those silent whispers go?
    Now, who’s going to lead me home?
    
    If all my stories were turned into poems,
    wouldn't every single one be an elegy?
    Mourning the broken constellations
    and moonlit conversations,
    like a lone sailor lost at sea.
    Now, who will my crew be?
    
    If all my stories were turned into poems,
    wouldn't every single one be an elegy?
    Mourning the moon that lost its gleam,
    no longer feeling the sun’s beam.
    Was it an hourglass I forgot to turn,
    stuck in time with memories to burn?

    You made me believe in love,
    And I still don't get how.
    That night on the bench,
    Not for a second did it leave my mind.
    In rain were we drenched,
    But we both didn't mind.
    
    You said, "Wait for me,"
    I asked, "How long?"
    Your eyes already a stream,
    And I knew it was for long.
    "But why?" You couldn't tell,
    And no, I didn't want to guess.
    
    You put us both through hell,
    We both were a complete mess.
    I don't get your reasons,
    I still don't understand you,
    But after all these passing seasons,
    There's still nobody but you.
    
    So if it takes a million years to meet those eyes of yours,
    I will wait lightyears for it.
    Cause your eyes, they hold all my cures,
    And I know all this plight is worth it.
    
    For you made me believe in love.

    Dear Santa,
    Am I on your naughty or nice list?
    If I've been nice, then send me a gift.
    Chocolates and toys, I've got them a-plenty,
    Dresses and sneakers—nay, I don't want anything fancy.
    Tablets and headphones, I've got no use,
    Don't send me books and call it a truce.
    But, dear Santa,
    If I'm on your nice list,
    Can you send me a friend as a gift?

    I hugged you like you're my world
    Thorns all up your body
    Pricked into my soul
    No, I didn't feel any pain
    Though I was bleeding
    It didn't matter when
    It's you in my arms I'm holding
    
    Then you pushed me away
    And the wounds all opened up
    This time it hurt
    Until I bled to death
    
    If given the chance to turn back time
    I'd still hug you like you're my world
    Until thorns all up your body
    Pricked into my soul
    No, I won't regret it
    Though I'd still bleed and you'd still leave
    For you I would do it
    All over and over and over again
